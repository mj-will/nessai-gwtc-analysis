# GWTC analysis with nessai

Analyses of different events from the various graviational-wave transient catalogs produced by the LVK using `nessai`.
These analyses are presented and discussed in my thesis (pending public link).

This analysis makes use of `nessai`, `bilby`, `bilby_pipe` and their various dependencies.

## Settings

Reference time is set to the detector with highest SNR based on the PyCBC triggers.
